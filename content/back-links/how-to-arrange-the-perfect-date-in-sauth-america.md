Once you have restricted your selection to 2 or 3 escorts, just get in contact with them: the website provides easy buttons to start a call or a whatsapp chat with them.
Keep in mind that if you contact an escort from an agency, you will talk with an agent, while if you contact an independent escort, you will talk with the escort directly.
Although you can find most of the needed info about the girl on the webpage, this is a good time to check if the plan you have is interesting for the escort. 
Once you have selected the final one, remember to arrange all the details: where to meet and at what time.

## How to pay the escort
Keep in mind that the fee shown on the website is the hourly fee and for your long meeting you will be asked for a higher fee.
Don’t let the escort lose her time, communicate as soon as possible your preferred date and  time for the meeting and the duration.
Also remember that girls are offering a professional service and don’t like to discuss their fee. If you think that the fee is too high for you, just gently decline and look for another one.
Finally remember that unless agreed before, the girl is expecting to receive her fee at the beginning of the meeting in cash. In Paraguay it is usually common to get paid in Guaranies or US dollars.
An extra will be always appreciated and it will ensure you will be treated as a gentleman for the rest of the meeting.

## Dress code
