In an incall arrangement, the client will typically visit the escort at their place of business, which may be a private residence, hotel or other location.  
The escort will provide the address and directions, and the client will usually arrive at the agreed-upon time.  
Incall arrangements may offer more privacy and discretion for the client, as they are visiting the escort on their own terms.  

### Incall pros
- Privacy: Incall services afford the client greater privacy, as they are visiting the escort on their own terms.  
- Control: The client gets to choose the location, which can be especially appealing if they have certain preferences or needs that the escort may not be able to accommodate at their own location.  
- Discretion: Incall services often offer greater discretion, as the client can come and go anonymously.  

### Incall cons
- Accessibility: Depending on the location of the escortâ€™s residence or business, it may be difficult or time-consuming for the client to reach.  
- Safety: Incall services also require the client to travel to an unfamiliar place, which may be a concern for some. 

### Typical meeting   
- The client contacts the escort provider to reserve an appointment.  
The escort, who may have a private residence, hotel room, or other fixed location,  provides the client with an address, directions, and time of the appointment.  
- At the specified time, the client arrives at the escort's location and may need to provide additional payment and verification of their identity.  
- The service itself may involve a variety of activities, as determined by the escort's services offered and the client's preferences.  
- The client and escort communicate throughout the session to ensure a mutually enjoyable experience.  
- After the session is over, the client leaves the location and does not create any disturbance or attract attention to the location.  

It's important to note that all activities in an escort service should be consensual and legal, respecting the boundaries and needs of both parties involved.  
Escorts may have specific rules and expectations for clients using their location, such as not loitering around the building or returning at unexpected times.
