If you are looking for an escort that offers the BDSM service, you probably already know what this term refers to. If, on the contrary, you are simply curious, below you will find an explanation of the term.

### Meaning of the term BDSM
BDSM is an acronym for: Bondage, Dominance, Submission and Masochism

Let's see in detail the meaning of each of these words:

#### Bondage
Bondage is a term used in BDSM that means the practice of tying a person to limit their movements. In these erotic situations, there is often a master-slave dynamic, where the person being tied up consents to be restrained with ropes or other items. This establishes an asymmetrical power relationship between the dominant person and the submissive person.

#### Domination
Dominance is included in the term BDSM because one of the people involved in the erotic game assumes the role of Dominant and the other person assumes the role of Submissive. It is crucial to keep in mind that the Dominant should not cause harm to the Submissive, but make her feel pleasure.

#### Submission
The person who is the Submissive in a BDSM erotic act participates voluntarily and is placed in a passive role, receiving the pleasure provided by the Dominant. However, if at any time the Submissive does not feel comfortable, they can stop the actions and the Dominant must immediately respect their decision.

#### Masochism
Masochism is an erotic practice in which a person experiences pleasure when feeling pain. The person who practices masochism feels satisfied by being humiliated, hurt or uncomfortable by another person. In these situations, the masochist has control over when to take breaks and when to end the activity. It is important that these practices are previously agreed upon and that the limits of the subject are respected.
